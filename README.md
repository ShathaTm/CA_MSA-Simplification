# CA_MSA-Simplification

This repository contains 250 Classical Arabic (CA) Hadiths simplified to Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) using a Large Language Model (LLM). The LLM-generated MSA texts were subsequently revised and modified by a human annotator.

The  dataset is currently being rechecked to address comments from the paper reviewers. It will be publicly available soon.
